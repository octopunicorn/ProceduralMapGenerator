# Procedural Map Generator Module

The Procedural Map Generator Module is a plugin for Unreal Engine that allows for the dynamic generation of game maps using procedural algorithms. It provides a flexible framework for generating terrain, placing objects, defining paths, and laying out the map.

## Features

- Terrain Generation: Generate realistic and diverse terrain features, such as mountains, valleys, and rivers.
- Object Placement: Randomly or algorithmically place objects, such as props, vegetation, NPCs, and objectives, within the map.
- Pathfinding: Create paths and navigation routes for AI agents, NPCs, or players using pathfinding algorithms.
- Map Layout: Define the layout and structure of the map, including regions, zones, and interconnected areas.
- Rendering: Render the generated map using various rendering strategies and techniques.
