# Procedural Map Generator Module

The Procedural Map Generator Module is a plugin for Unreal Engine that allows for the dynamic generation of game maps using procedural algorithms. It provides a flexible framework for generating terrain, placing objects, defining paths, and laying out the map.

## Work in Progress

This project is currently in its early stages and is considered a work in progress. It is not yet feature-complete or stable. The purpose of this project is to develop a procedural map generator module for use in Unreal Engine games. The current focus is on setting up the project structure, implementing core functionalities, and establishing a foundation for further development.

### Project Goals

- Implement a flexible and modular procedural map generation system.
- Support various types of map generation algorithms and strategies.
- Provide a seamless integration with Unreal Engine and its existing systems.
- Ensure high performance and scalability for generating large and complex maps.
- Enable easy customization and extension for specific game requirements.

### Current Status

At this stage, the project is in the initial setup phase. The main tasks include:
- Defining the project structure and module organization.
- Setting up the core classes, interfaces, and dependencies.
- Researching and prototyping different map generation algorithms and strategies.
- Implementing basic functionality for generating terrain and biomes.

### Roadmap and Next Steps

In the near future, the project will focus on:
- Refining the map generation algorithms and strategies.
- Implementing additional map features, such as objects, props, and NPCs.
- Adding support for customizable parameters and settings.
- Incorporating performance optimizations and error handling.
- Conducting thorough testing and refining the module based on feedback.

Please note that the project is subject to changes and updates as development progresses. Contributions, feedback, and suggestions are welcome!

## Features

- Terrain Generation: Generate realistic and diverse terrain features, such as mountains, valleys, and rivers.
- Object Placement: Randomly or algorithmically place objects, such as props, vegetation, NPCs, and objectives, within the map.
- Pathfinding: Create paths and navigation routes for AI agents, NPCs, or players using pathfinding algorithms.
- Map Layout: Define the layout and structure of the map, including regions, zones, and interconnected areas.
- Rendering: Render the generated map using various rendering strategies and techniques.

## Getting Started

To use the Procedural Map Generator Module in your Unreal Engine project, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository or download the latest release.
2. Copy the module files to your Unreal Engine project's plugins folder.
3. Compile and build your Unreal Engine project.
4. In your project, create a new instance of the Procedural Map Generator module and configure its settings.
5. Use the module's API and interfaces to generate and manipulate maps programmatically.
